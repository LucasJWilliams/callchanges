# Chapter 4 – The Raise

In this chapter I am going to deal with what I think is one of the hardest aspects of Devon call change ringing, and that is the raise.

Elsewhere in the ringing world, ringing up is seen as a means to an end. We need to get the bells up in order to be able to ring other things, and we do it once at the start of our ringing session. If our bells are a little bit heavy, or if as is often the case, a sub-optimal number of ringers have turned up on time, we may get some of the bells up singly, three at a time, or whatever gets the job done with the least pain. We generally don’t view it as a performance and striking in the raise it rarely critiqued let alone corrected.

Let’s face it, ringing up in peal is difficult, and leading up in peal is very difficult. Fact. You are lucky if you regularly see it done well.

When I went on the Kingsteignton outing in 2021, a day that gave me my initial exposure to good call change ringing, I counted how many times bells were rung up and down, and it was 25 times in both directions. So it is little wonder that they are good at it.

In Devon, the raise and the lower – let’s use the terms they use now – are part of the performance and at least as important as the rest of the peal. In competitions the raise and lower are marked just the same as the call changes and so they need to be taken very seriously indeed.

This chapter is not going to teach you how to raise bells in peal. What it will do is explain how it is done differently in Devon, and give some tips on how to do it better and what to watch out for. My local band has been ringing up in this different style for just a couple of months as I write this, and our raising is already better than it used to be.
