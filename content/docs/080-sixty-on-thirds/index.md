# Chapter 7 - Sixty on 3rds

You have started to master closed handstroke leads, your ringing up is better than it used to be and your ringing down is approaching awesome. Chapter 4 introduced some call changes which form the first section of this “Sixty on 3rds” peal which is such a key part of the Devon call change culture and the test piece in Devon Association call change competitions. 

So what is it and how do you do it? 

As I said in Chapter 4, Sixty on 3rds is a call change peal comprising a formulaic sequence of sixty different changes. ‘Sixty’ because it is 60 changes long, and ‘on 3rds’ because the peal is based around Queens which has a historical alternative name ‘3rds’ (as in musically the successive bells are thirds apart). It is not designed to be musical in the traditional sense but is no less musical than, say, a 60 of Bob Doubles. It becomes easy to call once you know how it works, and ringers who ring it all the time will get to know it as well. 

The basic principle is that the treble hunts up and down the change (only to 5ths place) while the other bells do a systematic cycling round from Queens. One call affecting bells 2-5 (I’ll call them the ‘working bells’ for ease of reference) is made before each hunt of the treble up and down. 

To demonstrate the callings in 60 on 3rds I am going to use the following video from Dunsford. This is a very good peal rung by the Shaugh Prior band. The whole of the peal is here so I will walk you through the couple of blocks of calls and explain what the principle is, then you can print off the sheet of the calls and watch the rest of it yourself.
