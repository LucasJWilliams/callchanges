<strong>Chapter 6 - The Lower</strong>

<a class=anchor href=#chapter-6--the-lower>#</a></h1><p>Method ringers rarely go into the lower straight away after ringing changes. It usually only happens at the end of a longer piece of ringing, a quarter peal or peal, when the conductor will say “straight down” to avoid that inevitable five minutes of faffing about when ringers move around and fail to catch hold, claiming their hands hurt.</p><p>In Devon call change ringing the lower is much more likely to follow straight on from completion of the peal, and in competition ringing the lower is part of the marked performance.</p><p>As with the raise, I don’t see the purpose of this chapter to be teaching readers how to ring down. Rather I am going to identify how the lower is different in Devon call change ringing, and to suggest some ways in which bands can make their performance better.</p><p>Lowering bells is generally done much better than raising them – at least that is my experience with method ringing bands. The bells are going to lower themselves, so the secret of a successful lower in peal is getting the bells to all fall at the same speed. The lighter bells will need to be prevented from falling as quickly as they would like to, while the tenor is effectively going to fall at its natural pace.</p><p>That last comment is key, because unless you are deliberately trying to ring down quickly, you should ring down at the speed of the tenor. The treble just needs to stay striking after the tenor, and in order to do that the ringer of the treble will need to keep pulling so as to prevent the treble ringing down too quickly.</p><p>The first video in this chapter shows a Devon band ringing down on quite a heavy eight. What I think is particularly worth noting is the effort the back bells are putting into their handstrokes. Check out the guy on the 6th! Even with the handstroke disappearing and the sally too low for comfort, he is putting in a lot more effort than you might have seen in your average fall. This is commitment to the cause.</p><p>In your average fall by a method ringing band, ringers tend to concentrate on the backstroke and let the handstroke take care of itself. Maybe two thirds of the way down they won’t be guiding the sally at all. However the handstroke will not take good enough care of itself if you are aiming for excellence. Watch in this video how the back bells stay focused on the sally all the way to the bottom – only the last few strokes, when they are pulling in, do they make the switch to backstroke only, but by then the handstroke has gone anyway.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Owv7lD9qGnU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>The final thing to notice at the end of that clip is the standard way of finishing a Devon style lower. Gone is the “After three, miss one and catch in Queens”. They have the bells right down and then just stop, either after a count or just a call from the treble. Note the treble bell is still swinging but she doesn’t check it and risk an extra ding! An extra ding at the end is a career-limiting error.</p><p><em>TheRowing Boat Analogy</em>
I said this chapter wasn’t about teaching you to ring down, however I do want to discuss just one aspect of ringing down that causes the most issues, and how to avoid it. It also gives me the opportunity to introduce an analogy that works very well.</p><div class="book-columns flex flex-wrap"><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><img src=Sheepdog.jpeg alt=Sheepdog></div><div class="flex-even markdown-inner">I used to like watching “One man and his dog”, with Phil Drabble, and I often use sheepdog trialling analogies when ringing up. When I am leading up I am the sheepdog, and the other five ringers are my sheep. After the initial ‘lift’ when you get the sheep moving and start them trotting off in the right direction, you need to maintain a steady pace with no sudden shocks – nothing that will upset the sheep too much. If you see one of your sheep going astray, you need to keep the rest of the pack together while gradually scooping up the errant sheep and getting them back in – then you can continue the drive. Every so often, and we’ve all been there, the sheep go completely mad and scatter all over the field!</div></div></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
