There is a continuous stream of notes which is not interrupted by the open handstroke lead that method ringers insert. It is also said that the ringing of bells slightly below the balance generates a different sort of sound to method ringing where the bells go to the balance and stop for longer.\nAs I think it is always good to see what you are aiming at, here are a selection of videos of call change ringers in action. This video from Meavy in Devon includes the start of the raise and you will notice how all the ringers start to pull together on the first pull, then on the second pull the ropes are slightly spaced out, then on the final pull when they cause the bells to strike, they strike in rounds but very close together. This is one of my all-time favourite videos – all 12 at Buckfast Abbey being rung up in peal, followed by some call changes. And just one final defence for the method ringers. When the Central Council ran a YouTube competition during the Covid lockdown in 2020, there were two months where the criteria were films of the best striking on six and eight bells. I had an ulterior motive in proposing this, because I knew that fine call change ringing would be submitted and that a call change piece would win.\nThe very best method ringing bands achieve near perfect striking but usually in peals, but it never gets filmed. Call change peals benefit from being short and the best ringing is often in competition environments. It is not too onerous to put a GoPro on a cupboard and film for 10 minutes. Peal ringers never do this, and the highest quality method ringing is only heard by its exponents.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/callchanges/docs/020-down-there/","title":"Chapter 1 - They’re different down there","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 1 They’re different down there # As you have probably gathered, call change ringing is a feature of ringing in the South West of England – Devon and Cornwall specifically. These counties are not in a different country – you can visit them without a passport. If you do visit them, you may come across call change ringing in the style I am trying to explain in this book, so it is worth giving you a few notes and tips to prepare you for your experience.\nWhen visiting a call change tower in the South West, if they ask which bell you usually ring, don’t be a smart Alec and say “any of them”. That will not endear you to the locals. Just pick a middle bell to be safe. Treble and Tenor are specialist subjects so definitely don’t say the Treble unless you really are an expert, and only say tenor if you don’t really have another option.\nThere is some slightly different language used to describe method ringing. Method is often used in the singular when method ringers might use plural. “He does method as well” or “That tower does method”. You get used to it.\nMethod towers and call change towers seem to respect each other, and ringers who want to follow either code find the right home for them. Some ringers do both, and some don’t. The Devonshire Association is the call change association while the Guild of Devonshire Ringers caters for those wanting to ring methods. When visiting you may not know whether it will be a call change tower or a method tower.\nFrom the start I am going to annoy some ringers in Cornwall and other parts of the South West by referring to this genre as ‘Devon Call Changes’. The style is practiced elsewhere in the south west, in particular further west than Devon into Cornwall. However Devon Call Changes is an established term and I don’t think it’s my job to come up with a new word for it.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/callchanges/docs/030-first-principles/","title":"Chapter 2 - First Principles","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 2 First Principles # There are a few things that set Devon calls apart from the sort you are used to.\nClosed handstoke leads! # OK, so some of your ringers probably ring with closed handstroke leads anyway and you have given up telling them about it. A perfect open handstroke lead is actually quite difficult to achieve, and what is perfect anyway? You may be told to leave a whole bell’s gap, but actually about three quarters of a bell’s gap sounds OK. The best 12 bell bands perfect something even narrower and call it ‘style’.\nDevon call change ringing is done with closed handstroke leads, which is sometimes referred to elsewhere as ‘cartwheeling’. More about how to do this later.\nRinging up and down # When the Devon ringers ring in competitions, and most of the rest of the time too, they ring up and down at the beginning and end of each piece of ringing, which they will call a peal. This means they get very good at ringing up and down. Ringing the bells up and down is no longer just a means to an end – it is of equal importance to the rest of the ringing and is where competitions are won and lost.\nHowever, if you are starting your band off ringing in the style you don’t necessarily have to do the ringing up and down bit. Yet.\nFixed peals # Devon call change peals do not focus on the ‘musical changes’ that you are used to. They don’t go for a set that you might use for a wedding, going for instance from Queens, then Kings, and back, or you might mix Tittums and something else. The Devonians don’t do that, but ring long established and very formulaic sequences that many of the ringers know by heart. To be honest they are not musical in that sense at all, but that’s not the point.\nRinging one of those sequences, the famous “Sixty on Thirds” will be your first target, but there will be stages to go through before that.\nCompetition certificates at Kingsteignton\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/callchanges/docs/040-getting-started/","title":"Chapter 3 – Getting Started with Rounds","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 3 – Getting Started with Rounds # In this chapter I am just going to talk about getting the band ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead. Even this is quite an exhilarating thing to do and should be your first target. So, the treble’s handstroke will strike straight after the tenor’s backstroke has struck and there should be no way of telling which is the handstroke and which is the backstroke without looking.\nThat tends to be how you ring up, provided you ring up well (easier said than done). Good ringing up keeps the treble striking immediately after the tenor all the way up, and a handstroke gap is only introduced when you get to the top and are approaching setting the bells.\nIf you went up into the belfry and watched bells being rung to rounds by a band which rings with an open handstroke lead, you would see that at handstroke the bells are at or slightly past the balance, but at backstoke the bells don’t get to the balance. That is showing the pause that method ringers have at the handstroke lead.\nFor some inexplicable reason, and I have never really understood this, the pause that you feel at handstroke when ringing the treble disappears the further round the circle you go. It’s really quite exaggerated when you ring the treble, whereas the person on the tenor won’t feel as they are making any adjustment at all. It’s a bit odd.\nHere then is a video of some rounds with a closed handstroke lead, being rung by method ringers who have not tried doing this before. This is a little bit of a defence for it not being perfect. But that’s fine, because your first attempt will not be perfect either.\nThere are a few things to note from this:\nWhat you need to perfect is ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead without speeding up and starting to ring down! That can easily happen. Why do I say quickly? Because it sounds better and is easier to keep in rhythm.\nThe closed handstroke lead strikes straight after the tenor. It is not sloppy – it is not a handstroke lead that is just dropped in quick – I am working really quite hard to make the treble strike immediately after the tenor – you can see me using my knees on quite a small bell – I wouldn’t be doing that if I was ringing with an open handstroke lead! You can see the second making an effort to push in as well, and the others to a lesser extent.\nWhat you then find is that you need to hold the backstroke up and it feels unnatural at first. You need to work quite hard at this, pushing the handstroke in more than you normally would but letting the backstroke go up. If you don’t let the backstroke go up then the ringing will get faster and faster and you will lose control.\nAs you get better at this you will be confident at ringing with the bells slightly below the balance. You might even take a coil just to make it easier and not have a lot of rope flapping around. Good Devon call change bands ring fast, with the bells at or slightly below the balance, so don’t be scared – push them in.\nAnd that’s really all I think you should try at first. Ring the bells up, close the handstroke lead in, and then ringing rounds in as good a rhythm as you can, driving them in at hand and keeping the backstrokes up. See how long you can keep it going! Then at the end you may need to slow down a bit, get the bells up the balance, and then you’ll be able to stand.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/callchanges/docs/050-call-changes/","title":"Chapter 4 - A few call changes","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 4 – A few call changes # Once you have mastered the basic rhythm of ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead it is time to introduce some call changes. In this chapter we are going to watch a call change peal that is 16 changes long and quite logical. It introduces the principles of 60 on 3rds without going too far. This call change peal will be the target.\nAgain this video is of me ringing the treble with five young ringers all of whom were ringing closed handstroke lead call changes for the first time. I rather surprised them, but we had a videographer present for another reason so I took the opportunity to make film specifically for this book. It may be a bit rough around the edges but as with the rounds in the previous chapter, this is a learning process and I hope we show how it is accessible but challenging. To be fair to them they did really well.\nThis video starts when the bells are about two thirds of the way up so the first minute and a half is the end of the raise. These ringers did not know the bells so were learning about the odd-struckness during the raise!\nThen at about 1:43 I start the calls as follows:\n45\n23\n25\nThose three calls is how the famous “60 on 3rds” starts, by getting the bells into Queens. So watch the video now and pause when the bells get to Queens at about 2:00. Note how I dispense with the word ‘to’ in between the bell numbers. You don’t need it and in my experience the Devon ringers don’t say it. It is quicker and clearer just to say “45” rather than “4 to 5”. (It is actually the way call changes are done in Birmingham city centre as well so I am used to it.)\nIn case you were wondering whether the bells are called down or up, the answer is up. There is no arguing here. If you’re about to say calling up is somehow wrong, get over it. It’s part of the style.\nSecond thing to note is the rhythm of it. The style is to have the calls at regular metronomic intervals. I am calling the changes every second handstroke, which gives four rows for each change. You could go for every third handstroke to start with, but every second handstroke should be the aim.\nOK, now go back to the video and play on. What I do next is call the treble up to the back – again this is how 60 on 3rds starts. The calls are:\n13 (3 leads)\n15\n12\n14 which takes the bells to 352416\nPause at 2:27\nThat segment then includes one of the things that is hardest to get right for a band doing this for the first time – a different bell taking the lead and getting the handstroke in the right place straight away. It is quite hard to do because you really have to push the handstroke in, without letting the backstroke drop. Watch the ringer of the 3rd as he is called to lead. Is he just a wincey bit slow?\nGo back to the video and play on again. What happens next is that the 3 comes up one place, making the 5 lead, and then the treble ‘hunts’ back to the front again. 5 has to push in quickly and demonstrates neatly how it is quite difficult to get this right first time. Treble comes down to the front and then I put my hands up and admit I was slow leading too ☹\nSo the calls are:\n35\n41\n21\n31\n51 which takes the bells to 153246 (nice)\nPause again\n60 on 3rds then continues with a systematic process which will be explained in a later chapter but for now I am going to call this back to rounds and it is going to serve as the first practice peal. So, I move the 5 up after 3 to get back into Queens, and call it back to rounds.\nThe calls are:\n53\n52\n32\n54 which takes the bells to rounds.\nThat therefore is the peal I recommend you practice now. It is useful because it introduces some of the principles of 60 on 3rds, bringing it round after a convenient amount of time.\nThe main takeaways from this chapter are:\n•\tRegular changes - try and be consistently two or three handstrokes apart\n•\tThe bell going into lead will need to try very hard not to be slow\n•\tThis principle of the treble hunting up and down the change is common in Devon call change ringing\n•\tThe tenor ringer needs to be as steady as a rock\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/callchanges/docs/060-the-raise/","title":"Chapter 5 - The Raise","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 4 – The Raise # In this chapter I am going to deal with what I think is one of the hardest aspects of Devon call change ringing, and that is the raise.\nElsewhere in the ringing world, ringing up is seen as a means to an end. We need to get the bells up in order to be able to ring other things, and we do it once at the start of our ringing session. If our bells are a little bit heavy, or if as is often the case, a sub-optimal number of ringers have turned up on time, we may get some of the bells up singly, three at a time, or whatever gets the job done with the least pain. We generally don’t view it as a performance and striking in the raise it rarely critiqued let alone corrected.\nLet’s face it, ringing up in peal is difficult, and leading up in peal is very difficult. Fact. You are lucky if you regularly see it done well.\nWhen I went on the Kingsteignton outing in 2021, a day that gave me my initial exposure to good call change ringing, I counted how many times bells were rung up and down, and it was 25 times in both directions. So it is little wonder that they are good at it.\nIn Devon, the raise and the lower – let’s use the terms they use now – are part of the performance and at least as important as the rest of the peal. In competitions the raise and lower are marked just the same as the call changes and so they need to be taken very seriously indeed.\nThis chapter is not going to teach you how to raise bells in peal. What it will do is explain how it is done differently in Devon, and give some tips on how to do it better and what to watch out for. My local band has been ringing up in this different style for just a couple of months as I write this, and our raising is already better than it used to be.\n“It’s not rocket science – you just follow the bell in front of you” - Ian Avery The treble starts the race,\nThe second makes the space,\nThe tenor sets the pace\nI used to like watching “One man and his dog”, with Phil Drabble, and I often use sheepdog trialling analogies when ringing up. When I am leading up I am the sheepdog, and the other five ringers are my sheep. After the initial ‘lift’ when you get the sheep moving and start them trotting off in the right direction, you need to maintain a steady pace with no sudden shocks – nothing that will upset the sheep too much. If you see one of your sheep going astray, you need to keep the rest of the pack together while gradually scooping up the errant sheep and getting them back in – then you can continue the drive. Every so often, and we’ve all been there, the sheep go completely mad and scatter all over the field! I am going to look at three phases of the raise. Just as with the sheepdog trial, there is the lift, the drive, and then sticking them in the pen at the end. This translates roughly into the first half a dozen pulls at the beginning, then the main raise, and then how you slow down to call change speed at the end. In each of these three phases, good call change bands do things a little differently to what method ringers might be used to, and there are differences that can be applied to ringing up generally to useful effect.\nPhase 1 – the start # Immediately there is a difference in the way Devon call change ringers start the raise. Instead of each bell coming in singly - 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, all the bells come in at the same time and with the same pull - 123456 – all the bells strike in the first round.\nHow is this achieved? It is often call ‘pitching in’ and what they do is start with two pulls of the sallies which do not cause the bells to strike but get the bells swinging, and then give a big third pull to the make all the bells strike in rounds from the off.\nI think this is quite clever because it plays on the fact that all the bells have slightly different swing speeds so it will start the bells off in very close rounds. If every ringer does their first pull exactly at the same time, the natural swing speeds will cause the second pull to be slightly more spaced out (treble will be a little earlier than the second and so on) then the third pull they are a little more spaced out again, BUT NOT MUCH.\nSo the bells all set off in an upwardly direction very close together, and it sounds good.\nThat is a cue for the first demonstration video – just watch the first 40 seconds of this then pause it: Notice how the instruction at the beginning is just “going….gone” at which point all six ringers pull at the same time. There are two silent pulls, then a bigger pull that causes all bells to strike. There is no convention for what to say to start off. Different bands develop their own way of doing it. As I have introduced this in my band it has taken a while to know how to start! Definitely having silence and a pause beforehand helps, then everyone needs to be clear when the treble is going to start pulling. Key is for your band to get consistent and understand the plan. Phase 2 # The middle part of the raise shouldn’t really be any different to you what you are used to – it’s just an increased focus on doing it as well as possible. If you go back and continue with the Kenn video above, one thing you should see in particular is the constant pushing in of the handstrokes, letting the backstrokes rise.\nFrom 40 seconds in see how the treble ringer is pushing the handstroke in so the bell is striking immediately after the tenor – all the way up (this clip finishes before the top).\nNotice also how most of the ringers in this clip, and most Devon call change ringers anywhere, let the rope slide through their hands from the handstroke to the backstroke, something that is often frowned upon in other circles. Whilst not saying that you have to do it, it is worth understanding why they do it. It is to get much more of a constant feel for the bell, being perfectly in control, able to adjust at the last moment, and removing any chance of the backstroke being slow.\nThis is why it is important to use the sally as early as possible. Too many ringers leave the sally alone and think they can ring up just by pulling the backstroke, but everyone should be encouraged to use the handstroke every time and as early as possible. Pushing the handstroke in is very important and you need to be able to control the bell both strokes in order to fine tune its placement.\nA number of things commonly go wrong in the raise but all these problems are essentially the same – bells not going up at the same speed. The tenors might think that they have to pull with all their might in order to keep up, but if the treble is being careful not to go up too fast lest they lose their second or third sheep, the tenors need to rein in their enthusiasm and be mindful of what is happening earlier in the row.\nWhat can also often happen is the 2 and 3 leave too much of a space – they don’t keep close enough to the treble, and can end up taking up more than half the space that each complete row needs to take up. On the smaller bells you really should feel that you are pushing the handstrokes right in and holding the backstrokes up. It’s a drive.\nEven more common though is the treble just not going up at a speed that suits all the other ringer and not understanding what is going wrong – too fast and you lose those who cannot pull hard enough or keep up – too slow and others will go up too fast.\nThe bottom line is that “The tenor sets the pace” – you cannot go up faster than the tenor can manage or they will end up with a hernia (common tenor ringer condition). So the tenor effectively sets the pace, and the other bells fit in.\nIf you all start together, go up steadily with the treble making sure to strike immediately after the tenor both strokes, it ought to work. “It’s not rocket science -you just follow the bell in front of you.”\nOne of my criticisms of Devon call change ringing is that including the raise in every peal means that people who are not strong enough to pull up the back bells in peal, girls and women in particular, do not get a chance then to ring heavier bells during the call change ringing itself. As experience of ringing heavier bells is good for everyone and should be gender-blind, I think it is important to have at least some ringing that is done from set, or “off the stay” as it is described, to give everyone the chance to ring heavy bells. Phase 3 # In the sort of ringing up you are probably used to, the slowing down at the end happens because the treble opens up the handstroke gap. When ringing with closed handstroke leads you need a different way of slowing down, or getting to what I call ‘battle speed’. At battle speed the bells don’t quite go over the balance.\nTop call change bands have a very good understanding between the treble and tenor in particular and the slow down is gradual and relatively instinctive. “The second makes the space” – responsibility also falls on the second to make what might be an almost imperceptible opening up of the gap which the other bells can follow. If you’re thinking about where to put your best ringers, the second is a critical position.\nThere is no silver bullet for being able to do this well unfortunately\u0026hellip;\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/callchanges/docs/100-acknowledgements/","title":"Acknowledgements","section":"Docs","content":" Acknowledgements # Firstly to Bryn Reinstadler, who in writing her eBook Calling it Round showed me how an eBook can be produced and published quickly using Hugo on GitHub.
