[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/015-ultimate-goal/","title":"The Ultimate Goal","section":"Docs","content":" The ultimate goal # Devon call change ringing done well is a mesmerising sound. There is a continuous stream of notes which is not interrupted by the open handstroke lead that method ringers insert. It is also said that the ringing of bells slightly below the balance generates a different sort of sound to method ringing where the bells go to the balance and stop for longer.\nAs I think it is always good to see what you are aiming at, here are a selection of videos of call change ringers in action. This video from Meavy in Devon includes the start of the raise and you will notice how all the ringers start to pull together on the first pull, then on the second pull the ropes are slightly spaced out, then on the final pull when they cause the bells to strike, they strike in rounds but very close together. This is one of my all-time favourite videos – all 12 at Buckfast Abbey being rung up in peal, followed by some call changes. And just one final defence for the method ringers. When the Central Council ran a YouTube competition during the Covid lockdown in 2020, there were two months where the criteria were films of the best striking on six and eight bells. I had an ulterior motive in proposing this, because I knew that fine call change ringing would be submitted and that a call change piece would win.\nThe very best method ringing bands achieve near perfect striking but usually in peals, but it never gets filmed. Call change peals benefit from being short and the best ringing is often in competition environments. It is not too onerous to put a GoPro on a cupboard and film for 10 minutes. Peal ringers never do this, and the highest quality method ringing is only heard by its exponents.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/020-down-there/","title":"Chapter 1 - They’re different down there","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 1 They’re different down there # As you have probably gathered, call change ringing is a feature of ringing in the South West of England – Devon and Cornwall specifically. These counties are not in a different country – you can visit them without a passport. If you do visit them, you may come across call change ringing in the style I am trying to explain in this book, so it is worth giving you a few notes and tips to prepare you for your experience.\nWhen visiting a call change tower in the South West, if they ask which bell you usually ring, don’t be a smart Alec and say “any of them”. That will not endear you to the locals. Just pick a middle bell to be safe. Treble and Tenor are specialist subjects so definitely don’t say the Treble unless you really are an expert, and only say tenor if you don’t really have another option.\nThere is some slightly different language used to describe method ringing. Method is often used in the singular when method ringers might use plural. “He does method as well” or “That tower does method”. You get used to it.\nMethod towers and call change towers seem to respect each other, and ringers who want to follow either code find the right home for them. Some ringers do both, and some don’t. The Devonshire Association is the call change association while the Guild of Devonshire Ringers caters for those wanting to ring methods. When visiting you may not know whether it will be a call change tower or a method tower.\nFrom the start I am going to annoy some ringers in Cornwall and other parts of the South West by referring to this genre as ‘Devon Call Changes’. The style is practiced elsewhere in the south west, in particular further west than Devon into Cornwall. However Devon Call Changes is an established term and I don’t think it’s my job to come up with a new word for it.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/030-first-principles/","title":"Chapter 2 - First Principles","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 2 First Principles # There are a few things that set Devon calls apart from the sort you are used to.\nClosed handstoke leads! # OK, so some of your ringers probably ring with closed handstroke leads anyway and you have given up telling them about it. A perfect open handstroke lead is actually quite difficult to achieve, and what is perfect anyway? You may be told to leave a whole bell’s gap, but actually about three quarters of a bell’s gap sounds OK. The best 12 bell bands perfect something even narrower and call it ‘style’.\nDevon call change ringing is done with closed handstroke leads, which is sometimes referred to elsewhere as ‘cartwheeling’. More about how to do this later.\nRinging up and down # When the Devon ringers ring in competitions, and most of the rest of the time too, they ring up and down at the beginning and end of each piece of ringing, which they will call a peal. This means they get very good at ringing up and down. Ringing the bells up and down is no longer just a means to an end – it is of equal importance to the rest of the ringing and is where competitions are won and lost.\nHowever, if you are starting your band off ringing in the style you don’t necessarily have to do the ringing up and down bit. Yet.\nFixed peals # Devon call change peals do not focus on the ‘musical changes’ that you are used to. They don’t go for a set that you might use for a wedding, going for instance from Queens, then Kings, and back, or you might mix Tittums and something else. The Devonians don’t do that, but ring long established and very formulaic sequences that many of the ringers know by heart. To be honest they are not musical in that sense at all, but that’s not the point.\nRinging one of those sequences, the famous “Sixty on Thirds” will be your first target, but there will be stages to go through before that.\nCompetition certificates at Kingsteignton\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/040-getting-started/","title":"Chapter 3 – Getting Started with Rounds","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 3 – Getting Started with Rounds # In this chapter I am just going to talk about getting the band ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead. Even this is quite an exhilarating thing to do and should be your first target. So, the treble’s handstroke will strike straight after the tenor’s backstroke has struck and there should be no way of telling which is the handstroke and which is the backstroke without looking.\nThat tends to be how you ring up, provided you ring up well (easier said than done). Good ringing up keeps the treble striking immediately after the tenor all the way up, and a handstroke gap is only introduced when you get to the top and are approaching setting the bells.\nIf you went up into the belfry and watched bells being rung to rounds by a band which rings with an open handstroke lead, you would see that at handstroke the bells are at or slightly past the balance, but at backstoke the bells don’t get to the balance. That is showing the pause that method ringers have at the handstroke lead.\nFor some inexplicable reason, and I have never really understood this, the pause that you feel at handstroke when ringing the treble disappears the further round the circle you go. It’s really quite exaggerated when you ring the treble, whereas the person on the tenor won’t feel as they are making any adjustment at all. It’s a bit odd.\nHere then is a video of some rounds with a closed handstroke lead, being rung by method ringers who have not tried doing this before. This is a little bit of a defence for it not being perfect. But that’s fine, because your first attempt will not be perfect either.\nThere are a few things to note from this:\nWhat you need to perfect is ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead without speeding up and starting to ring down! That can easily happen. Why do I say quickly? Because it sounds better and is easier to keep in rhythm.\nThe closed handstroke lead strikes straight after the tenor. It is not sloppy – it is not a handstroke lead that is just dropped in quick – I am working really quite hard to make the treble strike immediately after the tenor – you can see me using my knees on quite a small bell – I wouldn’t be doing that if I was ringing with an open handstroke lead! You can see the second making an effort to push in as well, and the others to a lesser extent.\nWhat you then find is that you need to hold the backstroke up and it feels unnatural at first. You need to work quite hard at this, pushing the handstroke in more than you normally would but letting the backstroke go up. If you don’t let the backstroke go up then the ringing will get faster and faster and you will lose control.\nAs you get better at this you will be confident at ringing with the bells slightly below the balance. You might even take a coil just to make it easier and not have a lot of rope flapping around. Good Devon call change bands ring fast, with the bells at or slightly below the balance, so don’t be scared – push them in.\nAnd that’s really all I think you should try at first. Ring the bells up, close the handstroke lead in, and then ringing rounds in as good a rhythm as you can, driving them in at hand and keeping the backstrokes up. See how long you can keep it going! Then at the end you may need to slow down a bit, get the bells up the balance, and then you’ll be able to stand.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/050-call-changes/","title":"Chapter 4 - A few call changes","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 4 – A few call changes # Once you have mastered the basic rhythm of ringing rounds with a closed handstroke lead it is time to introduce some call changes. In this chapter we are going to watch a call change peal that is 16 changes long and quite logical. It introduces the principles of 60 on 3rds without going too far. This call change peal will be the target.\nAgain this video is of me ringing the treble with five young ringers all of whom were ringing closed handstroke lead call changes for the first time. I rather surprised them, but we had a videographer present for another reason so I took the opportunity to make film specifically for this book. It may be a bit rough around the edges but as with the rounds in the previous chapter, this is a learning process and I hope we show how it is accessible but challenging. To be fair to them they did really well.\nThis video starts when the bells are about two thirds of the way up so the first minute and a half is the end of the raise. These ringers did not know the bells so were learning about the odd-struckness during the raise!\nThen at about 1:43 I start the calls as follows:\n45\n23\n25\nThose three calls is how the famous “60 on 3rds” starts, by getting the bells into Queens. So watch the video now and pause when the bells get to Queens at about 2:00. Note how I dispense with the word ‘to’ in between the bell numbers. You don’t need it and in my experience the Devon ringers don’t say it. It is quicker and clearer just to say “45” rather than “4 to 5”. (It is actually the way call changes are done in Birmingham city centre as well so I am used to it.)\nIn case you were wondering whether the bells are called down or up, the answer is up. There is no arguing here. If you’re about to say calling up is somehow wrong, get over it. It’s part of the style.\nSecond thing to note is the rhythm of it. The style is to have the calls at regular metronomic intervals. I am calling the changes every second handstroke, which gives four rows for each change. You could go for every third handstroke to start with, but every second handstroke should be the aim.\nOK, now go back to the video and play on. What I do next is call the treble up to the back – again this is how 60 on 3rds starts. The calls are:\n13 (3 leads)\n15\n12\n14 which takes the bells to 352416\nPause at 2:27\nThat segment then includes one of the things that is hardest to get right for a band doing this for the first time – a different bell taking the lead and getting the handstroke in the right place straight away. It is quite hard to do because you really have to push the handstroke in, without letting the backstroke drop. Watch the ringer of the 3rd as he is called to lead. Is he just a wincey bit slow?\nGo back to the video and play on again. What happens next is that the 3 comes up one place, making the 5 lead, and then the treble ‘hunts’ back to the front again. 5 has to push in quickly and demonstrates neatly how it is quite difficult to get this right first time. Treble comes down to the front and then I put my hands up and admit I was slow leading too ☹\nSo the calls are:\n35\n41\n21\n31\n51 which takes the bells to 153246 (nice)\nPause again\n60 on 3rds then continues with a systematic process which will be explained in a later chapter but for now I am going to call this back to rounds and it is going to serve as the first practice peal. So, I move the 5 up after 3 to get back into Queens, and call it back to rounds.\nThe calls are:\n53\n52\n32\n54 which takes the bells to rounds.\nThat therefore is the peal I recommend you practice now. It is useful because it introduces some of the principles of 60 on 3rds, bringing it round after a convenient amount of time.\nThe main takeaways from this chapter are:\n•\tRegular changes - try and be consistently two or three handstrokes apart\n•\tThe bell going into lead will need to try very hard not to be slow\n•\tThis principle of the treble hunting up and down the change is common in Devon call change ringing\n•\tThe tenor ringer needs to be as steady as a rock\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/060-the-raise/","title":"Chapter 5 - The Raise","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 5 – The Raise # In this chapter I am going to deal with what I think is one of the hardest aspects of Devon call change ringing, and that is the raise.\nElsewhere in the ringing world, ringing up is seen as a means to an end. We need to get the bells up in order to be able to ring other things, and we do it once at the start of our ringing session. If our bells are a little bit heavy, or if as is often the case, a sub-optimal number of ringers have turned up on time, we may get some of the bells up singly, three at a time, or whatever gets the job done with the least pain. We generally don’t view it as a performance, and striking in the raise it rarely critiqued let alone corrected.\nLet’s face it, ringing up in peal is difficult, and leading up in peal is very difficult. Fact. You are lucky if you regularly see it done well.\nWhen I went on the Kingsteignton outing in 2021, a day that gave me my initial exposure to good call change ringing, I counted how many times bells were rung up and down, and it was 25 times in both directions. So it is little wonder that they are good at it.\nIn Devon, the raise and the lower – let’s use the terms they use now – are part of the performance and at least as important as the rest of the peal. In competitions the raise and lower are marked just the same as the call changes and so they need to be taken very seriously indeed.\nThis chapter is not going to teach you how to raise bells in peal. What it will do is explain how it is done differently in Devon, and give some tips on how to do it better and what to watch out for. My local band has been ringing up in this different style for just a couple of months as I write this, and our raising is already better than it used to be.\n“It’s not rocket science – you just follow the bell in front of you” - Ian Avery The treble starts the race,\nThe second makes the space,\nThe tenor sets the pace\nI used to like watching “One man and his dog”, with Phil Drabble, and I often use sheepdog trialling analogies when ringing up. When I am leading up I am the sheepdog, and the other five ringers are my sheep. After the initial ‘lift’ when you get the sheep moving and start them trotting off in the right direction, you need to maintain a steady pace with no sudden shocks – nothing that will upset the sheep too much. If you see one of your sheep going astray, you need to keep the rest of the pack together while gradually scooping up the errant sheep and getting them back in – then you can continue the drive. Every so often, and we’ve all been there, the sheep go completely mad and scatter all over the field! I am going to look at three phases of the raise. Just as with the sheepdog trial, there is the lift, the drive, and then sticking them in the pen at the end. This translates roughly into the first half a dozen pulls at the beginning, then the main raise, and then how you slow down to call change speed at the end. In each of these three phases, good call change bands do things a little differently to what method ringers might be used to, and there are differences that can be applied to ringing up generally to useful effect.\nPhase 1 – the start # Immediately there is a difference in the way Devon call change ringers start the raise. Instead of each bell coming in singly - 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, all the bells come in at the same time and with the same pull - 123456 – all the bells strike in the first round.\nHow is this achieved? It is often call ‘pitching in’ and what they do is start with two pulls of the sallies which do not cause the bells to strike but get the bells swinging, and then give a big third pull to the make all the bells strike in rounds from the off.\nI think this is quite clever because it plays on the fact that all the bells have slightly different swing speeds so it will start the bells off in very close rounds. If every ringer does their first pull exactly at the same time, the natural swing speeds will cause the second pull to be slightly more spaced out (treble will be a little earlier than the second and so on) then the third pull they are a little more spaced out again, BUT NOT MUCH.\nSo the bells all set off in an upwardly direction very close together, and it sounds good.\nThat is a cue for the first demonstration video – just watch the first 40 seconds of this then pause it: Notice how the instruction at the beginning is just “going….gone” at which point all six ringers pull at the same time. There are two silent pulls, then a bigger pull that causes all bells to strike.\nThere is no convention for what to say to start off. Different bands develop their own way of doing it. As I have introduced this in my band it has taken a while to know how to start! Definitely having silence and a pause beforehand helps, then everyone needs to be clear when the treble is going to start pulling. Key is for your band to get consistent and understand the plan.\nPhase 2 # The middle part of the raise shouldn’t really be any different to you what you are used to – it’s just an increased focus on doing it as well as possible. If you go back and continue with the Kenn video above, one thing you should see in particular is the constant pushing in of the handstrokes, letting the backstrokes rise.\nFrom 40 seconds in see how the treble ringer is pushing the handstroke in so the bell is striking immediately after the tenor – all the way up (this clip finishes before the top).\nNotice also how most of the ringers in this clip, and most Devon call change ringers anywhere, let the rope slide through their hands from the handstroke to the backstroke, something that is often frowned upon in other circles. Whilst not saying that you have to do it, it is worth understanding why they do it. It is to get much more of a constant feel for the bell, being perfectly in control, able to adjust at the last moment, and removing any chance of the backstroke being slow.\nThis is why it is important to use the sally as early as possible. Too many ringers leave the sally alone and think they can ring up just by pulling the backstroke, but everyone should be encouraged to use the handstroke every time and as early as possible. Pushing the handstroke in is very important and you need to be able to control the bell both strokes in order to fine tune its placement.\nA number of things commonly go wrong in the raise but all these problems are essentially the same – bells not going up at the same speed. The tenors might think that they have to pull with all their might in order to keep up, but if the treble is being careful not to go up too fast lest they lose their second or third sheep, the tenors need to rein in their enthusiasm and be mindful of what is happening earlier in the row.\nWhat can also often happen is the 2 and 3 leave too much of a space – they don’t keep close enough to the treble, and can end up taking up more than half the space that each complete row needs to take up. On the smaller bells you really should feel that you are pushing the handstrokes right in and holding the backstrokes up. It’s a drive.\nEven more common though is the treble just not going up at a speed that suits all the other ringers and not understanding what is going wrong – too fast and you lose those who cannot pull hard enough or keep up – too slow and others will go up too fast.\nThe bottom line is that “The tenor sets the pace” – you cannot go up faster than the tenor can manage or they will end up with a hernia (common tenor ringer condition). So the tenor effectively sets the pace, and the other bells fit in.\nIf you all start together, go up steadily with the treble making sure to strike immediately after the tenor both strokes, it ought to work. “It’s not rocket science -you just follow the bell in front of you.”\nPhase 3 # In the sort of ringing up you are probably used to, the slowing down at the end happens because the treble opens up the handstroke gap. When ringing with closed handstroke leads you need a different way of slowing down, or getting to what I call ‘battle speed’. At battle speed the bells don’t quite go over the balance.\nTop call change bands have a very good understanding between the treble and tenor in particular and the slow down is gradual and relatively instinctive. “The second makes the space” – responsibility also falls on the second to make what might be an almost imperceptible opening up of the gap which the other bells can follow. If you’re thinking about where to put your best ringers, the second is a critical position.\nThere is no silver bullet for being able to do this well unfortunately\u0026hellip;\n…although there are ways not to do it badly.\nTop of the list is not letting anyone go over the balance while still ringing one handed. This is very common and caused by a ringer’s fear of going two handed too early and not being in control, and by still pulling the backstroke too hard when the bell is nearly up. All ringers need to settle into the rhythm of pushing in the handstrokes and not pulling the backstrokes too firmly as the bells reach the balance.\nHere is another good example of a raise, this time at And just to show that when you are learning to do this and are not as experienced, here is an effort from Moseley. This is an average Sunday service band, used to ringing up in the ‘traditional way’ but with a few weeks of experimenting with ringing up in the Devon style. You can decide which of the faults identified above we are guilty of! Conclusion # Raising bells like this is very much a team game. All the band needs to be listening to every bell to get a feel for how a raise is progressing. The treble ringer is clearly very important, and the tenor ringer too, but the other ringers have their roles in the team. The ringer of the second has a very important job to set the pace and get the gap exactly right all the way up, including when starting to slow down at the top, but unless the other bells are in the right place you don’t stand a chance of getting a decent raise.\nPractice makes perfect. Make a feature of the ringing up every time you ring, rather than just seeing it as a means to an end. It is part of the performance, and just as noticeable to those people outside the tower who can hear the bells.\nThe main takeaways from this chapter are:\n•\tThe raise is a team game\n•\tSpeed is driven by the tenor\n•\tThe second needs to be very aware and get the gap right\n• Push the handstrokes in to get the backstrokes up\n•\tHandstrokes must be kept under close control from as early as possible\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/070-the-lower/","title":"Chapter 6 - The Lower","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 6 – The Lower # Method ringers rarely go into the lower straight away after ringing changes. It usually only happens at the end of a longer piece of ringing, a quarter peal or peal, when the conductor will say “straight down” to avoid that inevitable five minutes of faffing about when ringers move around and fail to catch hold, claiming their hands hurt.\nIn Devon call change ringing the lower is much more likely to follow straight on from completion of the peal, and in competition ringing the lower is part of the marked performance.\nAs with the raise, I don’t see the purpose of this chapter to be teaching readers how to ring down. Rather I am going to identify how the lower is different in Devon call change ringing, and to suggest some ways in which bands can make their performance better.\nLowering bells is generally done much better than raising them – at least that is my experience with method ringing bands. The bells are going to lower themselves, so the secret of a successful lower in peal is getting the bells to all fall at the same speed. The lighter bells will need to be prevented from falling as quickly as they would like to, while the tenor is effectively going to fall at its natural pace.\nThat last comment is key, because unless you are deliberately trying to ring down quickly, you should ring down at the speed of the tenor. The treble just needs to stay striking after the tenor, and in order to do that the ringer of the treble will need to keep pulling so as to prevent the treble ringing down too quickly.\nThe first video in this chapter shows a Devon band ringing down on quite a heavy eight. What I think is particularly worth noting is the effort the back bells are putting into their handstrokes. Check out the guy on the 6th! Even with the handstroke disappearing and the sally too low for comfort, he is putting in a lot more effort than you might have seen in your average fall. This is commitment to the cause.\nIn your average fall by a method ringing band, ringers tend to concentrate on the backstroke and let the handstroke take care of itself. Maybe two thirds of the way down they won’t be guiding the sally at all. However the handstroke will not take good enough care of itself if you are aiming for excellence. Watch in this video how the back bells stay focused on the sally all the way to the bottom – only the last few strokes, when they are pulling in, do they make the switch to backstroke only, but by then the handstroke has gone anyway.\nThe final thing to notice at the end of that clip is the standard way of finishing a Devon style lower. Gone is the “After three, miss one and catch in Queens”. They have the bells right down and then just stop, either after a count or just a call from the treble. Note the treble bell is still swinging but she doesn’t check it and risk an extra ding! An extra ding at the end is a career-limiting error.\nThe Rowing Boat Analogy\nI said this chapter wasn’t about teaching you to ring down, however I do want to discuss just one aspect of ringing down that causes the most issues, and how to avoid it. It also gives me the opportunity to introduce an analogy that works very well.\nFirst the analogy. Imagine a line of rowing boats with their rowers all trying to keep their boats moving forward at exactly the same speed. If one of them is getting slower they will fall behind, and in order to catch up with the others the rower will need to row harder. Their boat speeds up and is now going faster than the others, and it’s only a matter of time before they draw level. What happens then though? The boat that has caught up is going faster than the others and overtakes them! It is only level with the other boats for a fleeting moment. In order to get back in line, the rower eases off and their boat slows down. They are now going slower than the other boats. In a scene reminiscent of Gerard Hoffnung’s “Bricklayer’s Lament” , they go back past the other boats, but this time in the other direction.\nThis is a great analogy for ringing down (and up). The raise and lower are about controlling the rate of change of speed of the bell. In order to get a bell back into the right place it needs to be eased back, slowing down its rate of change as it gets to the right place, so as not to overshoot.\nThe problem is typically, and often dramatically or even fatally, exhibited by someone on a lighter bell taking a coil too early, taking in too much rope, and bringing their bell down. I often say to those following me “don’t take a coil before I do”, and I am always ready to give ‘encouragement’ to anyone who has let their bell drop in the coil-making process. The sheepdog keeps a beady eye on those sheep 😊.\nDropping a bell on taking the first coil also happens when the ringer just doesn’t pull hard enough during that crucial stroke. It’s the momentary lack of focus from thinking about making the coil – the handstroke doesn’t get the same attention, the coil is made, the backstroke drops a bit, and the pathway to disaster opens up.\nI asked my Devonian experts for any tips here and I got the following: “at the start of the fall, particularly on the lighter bells, it is beneficial to put a little more energy through the rope, i.e overpull slightly on both strokes, to ensure that when you do take the first couple of coils the bell doesn\u0026rsquo;t drop. Once you\u0026rsquo;re past that initial part of the fall then you can reduce the pull and concentrate on placing the handstroke in the correct place each time.”\nMoving up the rope is a gradual process. Nibble away with the coil hand – don’t take in too much, keep the rope tight at backstroke. Sliding the top hand down the rope after pulling the sally definitely helps with getting the backstroke exactly in the right place as there is more ‘feel’ for where the bell is. Notice in the lower in the following video from Hawkesbury (the lower starts at around 14 minutes) how the ringer on the 2nd takes her first coil with her hands a long way apart at backstroke and deftly makes the coil as hands start to descend.\nNotice again at the end of that peal, how they finish. You may be used to a lower which finishes with the front bells still swinging quite high when we catch at the end, and then the bells are brought to an abrupt halt. Notice in the Hawkesbury video how the trebles are hardly swinging at all at the bottom, and when the bells are called to ‘stop’ there is no risk of the clappers hitting the bells again.\nFinally, here is another video of a Devon band doing this really well.\nand one of my local band not doing it so well, but still not too bad.\nI said earlier in this chapter how the lower is included in the judging of Devon call change competitions. Faults are awarded for imperfect rows in the lower just as harshly as they are when the bells are at the top. I had always wondered how you can actually do a fall perfectly and hence get no faults because there is that point right near the bottom where the tenor stops striking on one side before the front bells do, and it becomes impossible to keep the treble striking exactly after the tenor both strikes.\nWhen I asked this question of the Devon experts, I was told that the trick is to just make that phase of the lower as short as possible, so you bring the bells in really quickly at the end. You can see that in the videos in this chapter. For the top call change bands, the end of the lower is one of the most difficult parts of an entire performance.\nThe main takeaways from this chapter are:\n•\tThe lower is a team game (I think I’ve said that before)\n•\tFront bells will fall too quickly if you’re not careful – keep them up especially at backstroke\n•\tEveryone needs to keep working on the handstrokes – they will not place themselves\n•\tThe first coil is high risk – encourage the front bells in particular not to take it too early, or take in extra rope at the same time as making the coil. Maybe overpull slightly.\n•\tThe back bells will need to work very hard at the end to bring the bells in quickly\n•\tThe style is not to have a miss and catch at the end – just stop. No stray dings!\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/080-sixty-on-thirds/","title":"Chapter 7 - Sixty on 3rds","section":"Docs","content":" Chapter 7 - Sixty on 3rds # You have started to master closed handstroke leads, your ringing up is better than it used to be and your ringing down is approaching awesome. Chapter 4 introduced some call changes which form the first section of this “Sixty on 3rds” peal which is such a key part of the Devon call change culture and the test piece in Devon Association call change competitions.\nSo what is it and how do you do it?\nAs I said in Chapter 4, Sixty on 3rds is a call change peal comprising a formulaic sequence of sixty different changes. ‘Sixty’ because it is 60 changes long, and ‘on 3rds’ because the peal is based around Queens which has a historical alternative name ‘3rds’ (as in musically the successive bells are thirds apart). It is not designed to be musical in the traditional sense but is no less musical than, say, a 60 of Bob Doubles. It becomes easy to call once you know how it works, and ringers who ring it all the time will get to know it as well.\nThe basic principle is that the treble hunts up and down the change (only to 5ths place) while the other bells do a systematic cycling round from Queens. One call affecting bells 2-5 (I’ll call them the ‘working bells’ for ease of reference) is made before each hunt of the treble up and down.\nTo demonstrate the callings in 60 on 3rds I am going to use the following video from Dunsford. This is a very good peal rung by the Shaugh Prior band. The whole of the peal is here so I will walk you through the couple of blocks of calls and explain what the principle is, then you can print off the sheet of the calls and watch the rest of it yourself.\nRun the video through to 1:06 and watch the first three calls being made to get into Queens by 1:35. What happens then is that the treble is hunted up to 5ths place – 13 15 12 14\nThe next block of changes starts at 2.10 and moves the 3rd up to 5ths place, and after each step the treble hunts up or down.\nSo the calls are:\n35 (first move of the working bell)\n41 21 31 51 (hunting the treble down to lead)\nThis has completed by 3:00. Then the 3rd is called up another place:\n32 (second move of the working bell)\n15 12 13 14 (hunt the treble up to the back)\n34 (final move of the first working bell)\n31 41 21 51 (hunting the treble back to lead)\nSo that is all the work of the 3rd being moved to the back. The next bell to work its way to the back is the 5th, and this starts in the video at 4.36. The 5th is systematically called out to 5ths place until it is following the 3rd, and after each move the treble does its shuttle manoeuvre (I think it’s a bit like a shuttle going backwards and forwards on a loom)\n52 (first move of the working bell)\n12 15 14 13 (hunting up)\n54 (5th moves up one more place)\n31 51 41 21 (treble back to lead)\n53 (final move of 5th) STOP VIDEO THERE\nHalf Peal # That gets us to a very convenient point, at 6:35 on the video. The 3rd and 5th have done their work and are sitting at the back before the tenor. The treble has hunted up and down a few times and the change is 124356.\nAt this point you can just call it round for what is known as a Half Peal. My band has found this to be a convenience place to stop, either because we are knackered, or it has taken enough time and we want to ring something else, or because the ringing hasn’t been good enough and we’ve not wanted to prolong the agony.\nThis band however carries on and you are going to try and follow the rest of it though, so pick up the video again from 6:35. If you want to print off the figures they can be found here.\nThe 2nd is going to be the next working bell (giving the 4th its first opportunity at leading), and finally the 4th.\nThe 4th gets into 5ths at 11.18 in the video, and this gets the bells back into Queens. The bells are called round, and then lowered.\nAnd that’s all there is to it!\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/100-acknowledgements/","title":"Acknowledgements","section":"Docs","content":" Acknowledgements # Firstly to Bryn Reinstadler, who in writing her eBook Calling it Round showed me how an eBook can be produced and published quickly using Hugo on GitHub. Then to Lucas Williams who rose to the challenge of working out how to write in Hugo and putting all these pages together for me.\nThe filming in chapters three and four was done by Dan Hunt and then edited by Colin Newman, leader of the CCCBR’s Schools and Youth groups Workgroup. The ringers in that filming were me, Rachel Mahoney, Ewan Hull, Hannah Read, Oliver Bates, and Orson Gee. They hadn’t expected to be filming this. They had all turned up just expecting to be helping with the production of a recruitment video for Scouts and Guides!\nFinally Ian Avery, Graham Sharland, and other members of the Kingsteignton band for their hospitality on their outing that gave me more of an insight into ringing in this style, and Ian and Graham again for various discussions and support over the last three years in my quest to promote this style of ringing more widely.\nSimon Linford eBook first published 1st May 2022.\n"}]
